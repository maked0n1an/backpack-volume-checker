<h2>Description</h2>

The bot is created to check the volume in [Backpack](https://backpack.exchange/refer/maked0n1an)
All data from the console is written to 'user_data/logs/main.log'. The code is executed asynchronously, the data matches 100% with the site.

For work you need to insert:
- cookies in 'input_data/cookies'; 
- proxies in 'input_data/proxies.txt'; 
- account names in 'input_data/account_names.txt' (optionally, read 'input_data/config.py')

Fork from the author: https://github.com/3asyPe/backpack-volume-checker

How to get a cookie?
1. Log in to each project account;
2. Press F12;
3. Go to the 'Network' tab any file that will .
3. Click the 'Fetch/XHR' filter just below;
4. Take any file that will have an orange sign and no extension (like the 'user' or 'capital' or 'assets' file).
5. In Request Headers, find the header/section called 'Cookie' and copy its value completely
6. Paste into 'input_data/cookies', one cookie is one line
